The way in which the comparators are defined is wrong. You should be able to
nest comparators, or list them. At the moment combining comparators requires the
developer to write a new comparator which combines the functions. You need to be
able to do something like this:-

<column name="account_name_wil" description="Account Name">
    <comparatorList>
        <comparator className="net.sourceforge.soshi.IgnoreWhitespaceComparator"/>
        <comparator className="net.sourceforge.soshi.IgnoreCaseComparator"/>
        <comparator className="net.sourceforge.soshi.BeginsWithComparator"/>
    </comparatorList>
</column>

The XML file loading uses a custom routine which utilises dom4j and SAXP. There
are more standard and more easily extendable ways of reading config file and are
* disgester
* JAXB
* carbine
We're going to use carbine as the rec already uses it for another configuration
file and therefore it's already in the build. Plus it's the nuts so we'll use it.
